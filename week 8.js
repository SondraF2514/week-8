//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//Use at least one array.
//Use at least two classes.
//Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//cars Menu

//cars Array

//class cars
//make
//model

class Car{
    constructor(make, model){
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }
}  
//class Menu
class Menu{
    constructor(){
//cars array
    this.cars = [];
    }
}

  //see a menu


  //add cars
  //prompt for a make
  //prompt for a model
  //create new car and push car into array

    Car Inventory:
    ----------------
